# Turtle-Racing-Game-in-Python

# ðŸ§µ Prerequisites
Very basic knowledge of Python programming will be enough to go through this tutorial. Also, I assume that you don't know anything about this turtle library. I will teach you everything from scratch.

# ðŸ›  Tools we'll use
First, if you don't have Python installed on your machine, go to python.org to download latest version of Python and then install it right away.

For writing the program, we will be using PyCharm which is the most popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. After installing PyCharm on your machine, you are ready to build this amazing game from scratch.
