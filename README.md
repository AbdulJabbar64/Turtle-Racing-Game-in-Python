# Turtle-Racing-Game-in-Python

<!-- ðŸ§µ -->
# Prerequisites
Very basic knowledge of Python programming will be enough to go through this tutorial. Also, I assume that you don't know anything about this turtle library. I will teach you everything from scratch.

# Tools we'll use
First, if you don't have Python installed on your machine, go to python.org to download latest version of Python and then install it right away.

For writing the program, we will be using PyCharm which is the most popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. After installing PyCharm on your machine, you are ready to build this amazing game from scratch.

# Project Goals
Concretely, we'll write a program that moves a turtle object horizontally until it reaches our calculated finish line. Then we will create seven unique replicas of this turtle object using a for loop along with different colors and random moving speeds.

We'll also add a background image (roads with lanes for the turtles to race in) to create something like a real racing environment.

Then we'll compute different values along the vertical or Y-axis to define their starting locations.

Finally, we will prompt the user to enter their bet (turtle color) so that if a user's bet color matches our winner turtle's color, we will display Winner! on the screen. Otherwise, we'll display You Lost! on the screen.
